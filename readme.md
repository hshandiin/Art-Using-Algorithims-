## Mike Tyka – Portraits of Imaginary People

The artist I found to be very interested is Mike Tyka! I was drawn to his work, particularly his creation “Portraits of Imaginary people” because of how futuristic it is. It is also a bit creepy to be honest, especially when I really thought about how he is literally creating faces of imaginary people! After reading the process he uses it is interesting to see how detailed algorithms can truly be. Specifically, inn his series Tyka, “explores the latent space of human faces by training a neural network to imagine and then depict portraits of people who don’t exist.” His exhibit, “Us and Them” the Kinetic Installation uses these imaginary people generated with tweets that were bots from 2016. The tweets of these imaginary people are continuously printed inthis display for people to interact with. Essentially, Tyka’s piece creates a space for viewers to interact with this creative world and reflect upon their one status as living with machines and learning to interact with each other.

## Allison Parrish – Rewordable

Allison Parrish is a computer programmer, poet, educator and game designer! In my search for artists using algorithms I came across her name primarily because she has produced a lot of cool pieces, but what stood out to me was her bio. Specifically, how she interconnects her art to address the, “unusual phenomena that blossom when language and computers meet.” The artwork I really liked was her game “Rewordable”. Her game is similar to a digital Scrabble and has a really aesthetically pleasing color scheme. The card game includes a deck of occurring letter combinations in the English language and players are tasked with arranging the cards to form words of increasing length and complexity. Parrish indicated in her blog that the issues she was confronted with was trying to make it better than Scrabble in that she hoped to avoid only single letter sequences. To fix this issue Parrish decided to make this game about playing with sequences of letters to make the game more fun!
